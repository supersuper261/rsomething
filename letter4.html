            I know this letter ay super late ko na toh mabibigay sayo, pero sana makahanap ako ng time para mabigay ko sayo parin. Na I have been thinking about the unspoken issues between us and want to discuss how my actions have affected our relationship. 
        </p>
       	    First and foremost, I want to apologize for keeping you in the dark and not explaining myself.  I now see that by keeping my problems to myself, I have not only treated you unfairly but also damaged our relationship. I am genuinely sorry for any pain and confusion I may have caused.
        </p>
        </p>
            After thinking about what happened, I couldn't help but think about the possibilities that could have occurred. If I had talked to you about my problems, would everything have turned out differently? These thoughts have been bothering me and I wish I had been more honest and open about the difficulties I was going through. I realized that my main issue was not caused by outside factors or other individuals, but rather by myself. During difficult times, my thoughts became overwhelming and I ended up feeling trapped in a place where silence seemed like the only solace. And maybe you will only know this or maybe the others will that yeah my thoughts had gaining suicidal thoughts and at some point of a year I've try but. Regrettably, this silence issue also affected our relationship, and I sincerely apologize for that.
        </p>
        </p>
            I want you to understand that I didn't make the decision to distance myself from you in a rational way. I now realize how much it negatively affected our relationship. It's difficult for me to admit that my actions led me to think about things that no one should ever have to go through. There were times when I felt overwhelmed by darkness, and I should have opened up to you about this. I understand the seriousness of my errors and am dedicated to gaining knowledge from them. I want to reassure you that I am actively seeking assistance and guidance to navigate through these difficult circumstances. I hope that, over time, with understanding and genuine effort, we can restore what has been damaged.
        </p>
        </p>
            I apologize if my words do not fully express how truly sorry I am for the pain I have caused. I truly value our relationship, and it saddens me to realize that my actions have put it at risk. And I want to give you my sincere gratitude for having discovered the profound essence of serendipity within your being.
        </p>
        </p>
            I appreciate you reading this letter and I hope we can find a way to resolve our issues and move on. If you're willing, I'm open to discussing any remaining questions or concerns.
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>ᗩᒪ</p>
